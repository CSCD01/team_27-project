Comments:

I was happy to see that the team is on the same page and collaborating
well. I suggest you put more effort into preparing for the second
interview, so that it looks and sounds more professional.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The project was introduced well, including a good demonstration.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well.

Process: As we have discussed, I would be happy to replace this part
of the interview grade with what you achieve in the second interview.
